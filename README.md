# Query Airtable

This app is made so you can get client information from your Airtable account using there API. You'll need to input your API key in the App.js file along with your Base ID, which you can get from the API docs when logged in. You'll also need to input which table you are wanting to query. 

Don't forget to modify the fields that'll display as they'll be different than the ones displayed here.
